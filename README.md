# algorithm-challenges
Collection of Algorithms, Data Structures, and Challenges to use for practicing
and learning how to solve problems with algorithms.

## Getting Started
This repo uses Bun. It's one of the easier ways to develop in TypeScript. To
install bun, follow the instructions here
[https://bun.sh/docs/installation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

## Running tests
With Bun, just run `bun test` to run all of your tests.

## Running Benchmarks
Some directories have benchmarks in them that were used to help figure out a
faster implementation. These will be in `bench/index.ts`. You can run them
by running `bun run <path-to-dir>/bench/index.ts`. Put variant functions in the
bench folder and you can import them in your tests.
