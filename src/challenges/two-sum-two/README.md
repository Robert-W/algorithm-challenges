## Example
* Input: sorted = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11], target = 9
* Output: [3, 4]
* Explanation: Return a non-zero indexed array representing the indices of two
  numbers whose sum is target. 

## Function Signature
findTargetSums(sorted: number[], target: number) -> number[]

## About
This is a simple problem that can be done easily with two pointers. Its time 
complexity is O(N).
